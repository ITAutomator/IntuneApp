This file is ANSI encoded. Leave it that way on purpose.
New .ps1 files should be UTF8 encoded.
However, you must replace these common character problems first

If you open this file in Notepad++ and switch between Encoding > UTF8 and Encoding > ANSI you will see the difference.
The From chars become garbled in the chart below.
But always save THIS file as ANSI.

Steps to safely convert a PowerShell .ps1 file from ANSI encoded file to UTF8
1. Open the suspected file in Notepad++
2. Look in the lower right corner for ANSI or UTF8
3. If it's ANSI:
4. Search and replace all the problem characters below.
5. Change it to UTF8: Encoding > UTF8 to SEE the problems (they will be black boxes)
6. Save the file as UTF8

For Bulk
1. Find in files named .ps1
2. Open all the files by double-clicking the search results.  This is so you can additionally save them as UTF8 (optional)
3. Replace in files named .ps1 (Make sure it's .ps1 otherwise you'll ruin this file)
